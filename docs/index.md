# Overview

[![Discuss on Matrix at #antsibull:ansible.com](https://img.shields.io/matrix/antsibull:ansible.com.svg?server_fqdn=ansible-accounts.ems.host&label=Discuss%20on%20Matrix%20at%20%23antsibull:ansible.com&logo=matrix)](https://matrix.to/#/#antsibull:ansible.com)

This is a Python library for processing Ansible documentation markup. It is named after [antsibull-docs](https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/) where this code originates from. It was moved out to make it easier to reuse the markup code in other projects without having to depend on all of antsibull-docs's dependencies.

antsibull-docs is covered by the [Ansible Code of Conduct](https://docs.ansible.com/projects/ansible/latest/community/code_of_conduct.html).
